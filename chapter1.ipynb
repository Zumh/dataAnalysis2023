    "This text discusses basic input and output operations in Python. It begins by introducing a simple \"Hello, world\" program that can be executed in a Python environment. Users are encouraged to edit the text within quotes and rerun the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text also demonstrates how to print multiple strings, which are concatenated by default with spaces. It explains that numerical expressions within the print function are evaluated and converted to strings, and then concatenated with spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the text introduces the input function, which allows users to read textual input from the user. This function is given a string parameter, which is printed as a prompt to the user. The example provided shows how to use the input function to store a user's name in a variable and then print a greeting with that name.\n",

    "In summary, the text covers basic Python concepts related to printing, user input, and program execution."

    "1. Using the if statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example, the user is asked to input an integer.\n",
    "The code checks whether the input integer x is greater than or equal to 0.\n",
    "If x is non-negative, it assigns x to the variable a. If x is negative, it assigns the absolute value of x to a.\n",
    "Finally, it prints the absolute value of x.\n",
    "2. The general form of an if-else statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides a general structure for if-else statements, which allows you to handle multiple conditions and execute different code blocks based on those conditions.\n",
    "3. Another example of if-else statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the user is asked to input a floating-point number.\n",
    "The code checks whether the input number c is positive, negative, or zero, and prints a corresponding message.\n",
    "4. Breaking the loop with break:\n",
    "\n",
    "This code demonstrates how to use the break statement to exit a loop when a specific condition is met.\n",
    "It iterates through a list l and breaks out of the loop as soon as it encounters the first negative element.\n",
    "The code then prints the first negative element found.\n",
    "5. Continuing the loop with continue:\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to use the continue statement to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next one.\n",
    "It iterates through the list l and, when it encounters a negative number, it continues to the next iteration.\n",
    "For non-negative numbers, it calculates and prints the square root and natural logarithm.\n",
    "These code snippets provide a practical understanding of how to use if-else statements and control flow in Python, including the use of break and continue in loops."
