    "This text discusses basic input and output operations in Python. It begins by introducing a simple \"Hello, world\" program that can be executed in a Python environment. Users are encouraged to edit the text within quotes and rerun the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text also demonstrates how to print multiple strings, which are concatenated by default with spaces. It explains that numerical expressions within the print function are evaluated and converted to strings, and then concatenated with spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the text introduces the input function, which allows users to read textual input from the user. This function is given a string parameter, which is printed as a prompt to the user. The example provided shows how to use the input function to store a user's name in a variable and then print a greeting with that name.\n",

    "In summary, the text covers basic Python concepts related to printing, user input, and program execution."

    "\n",
    "- Python's main data structures include strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
    "### Lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists are flexible containers for storing an arbitrary number of elements, even zero.\n",
    "- Elements are stored in sequential order, separated by commas, and enclosed in square brackets: [2, 100, \"hello\", 1.0].\n",
    "- Lists can contain elements of different types.\n",
    "### Tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuples are fixed-length, immutable, and ordered containers.\n",
    "- Elements in tuples are separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses: (3,), (1,3), (1, \"hello\", 1.0).\n",
    "- Tuples can also contain elements of different types.\n",
    "### Sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lists, tuples, and strings are referred to as sequences.\n",
    "- Common characteristics among sequences include:\n",
    "    - Length can be queried using len(sequence).\n",
    "    - min() and max() functions find the minimum and maximum elements.\n",
    "    - sum() adds all numeric elements together.\n",
    "    - Sequences can be concatenated using the + operator.\n",
    "    - Sequences can be repeated using the * operator (e.g., \"hi\" * 3 == \"hihihi\").\n",
    "### Indexing and Slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sequences are ordered and allow access to elements through indexing.\n",
    "- Indexing starts from 0, and negative integers index from the end.\n",
    "    - E.g., \"abcd\"[2] == \"c\", -1 refers to the last element.\n",
    "- Slicing allows you to extract a subsequence using the range [start:stop].\n",

    "    - Generic slicing: sequence[start:stop:step].\n",
    "    - Default values: start=0, stop=len(sequence), step=1.\n",
