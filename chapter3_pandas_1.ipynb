    "**Introduction to Pandas:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pandas DataFrame:**\n",
    "  - The Pandas library provides a DataFrame, a two-dimensional data structure built on top of NumPy.\n",
    "  - Allows naming columns and assigning indices to rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importing Pandas:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import pandas as pd\n",
    "  import numpy as np\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fetching and Displaying Data:**\n",
    "  - Example using weather data:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    wh = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csmastersUH/data_analysis_with_python_2020/master/kumpula-weather-2017.csv\")\n",
    "    wh.head()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing Columns:**\n",
    "  - Access a column by name:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    wh[\"Snow depth (cm)\"].head()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summary Statistics:**\n",
    "  - Calculate mean temperature:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    wh[\"Air temperature (degC)\"].mean()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dropping Columns:**\n",
    "  - Remove a column using the drop method:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    wh.drop(\"Time zone\", axis=1).head()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modifying DataFrame:**\n",
    "  - Add a new column:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    wh[\"Rainy\"] = wh[\"Precipitation amount (mm)\"] > 5\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Series in Pandas:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creating a Series:**\n",
    "  - Convert a one-dimensional iterable into a Series:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    s = pd.Series([1, 4, 5, 2, 5, 2])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Naming and Attributes:**\n",
    "  - Assign a name to the series:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    s.name = \"Grades\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Common Attributes:**\n",
    "  - Accessing name, dtype, and size:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    print(f\"Name: {s.name}, dtype: {s.dtype}, size: {s.size}\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexing and Slicing:**\n",
    "  - Examples of indexing, slicing, and fancy indexing:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    s[1]\n",
    "    s2 = s[[0, 5]]\n",
    "    t = s[-2:]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Values and Indices:**\n",
    "  - Accessing values and indices as NumPy arrays:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    s2.values\n",
    "    s2.index\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Indices:**\n",
    "  - Series with custom indices:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    s3 = pd.Series([1, 4, 5, 2, 5, 2], index=list(\"abcdef\"))\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessing by Index:**\n",
    "  - Accessing values using custom indices and NumPy style implicit integer indices:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    s3[\"b\"]\n",
    "    s3[1]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loc and iLoc Attributes:**\n",
    "  - Ambiguity resolution using loc and iloc attributes:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    s4 = pd.Series([\"Jack\", \"Jones\", \"James\"], index=[1, 2, 3])\n",
    "    s4.loc[1]\n",
    "    s4.iloc[1]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
